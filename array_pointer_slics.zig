// These are notes from the presentation on arrays, slices and pointers from "Solving common Pointer Conundrums" by Loris Cro

// Quick reference:
// [n]T = An array of length n containing type T
// [_]T = same as above the compiler is expected to infer the length of the array, length must be known at compile time
// *T = A pointer of type T
// [*]T = a many pointer, you will only really need to interact with these when interfacing with C code
// *[n]T = pointer to an array of length n and of type T, this converts to a slice automatically

//Declaration of an array
const a = [_]u8{ 1, 2, 3, 4 };
//Creating a slice from an array, accepts a range argument, start of range cannot be ommitted
const b = a[0..];

// ?*T = an optional pointer, can either be null or a valid pointer, essentially an Option<Ptr>
// *?T = a pointer to an optional, the pointer is always valid but the type could null
